# Tank_Big_Monster

<em><b>Tank Big Monster</b></em> is an Android game developed by Jeremy Liu (刘嘉洋), My_Devotion (董和鑫) and Derek Ken (邓瑞康, i.e., myself). 

Actually, we had a good sense of teamwork while working together to accomplish this very curriculum project of our Android course during the <em>2nd</em> semester of our junior year at Nankai University. Specifically speaking, <b>Jeremy (刘嘉洋)</b> was mainly in charge of AI mode while <b>My_Devotion (董和鑫)</b> concentrated on implementing game-control logics on mobile phones (arrows, buttons and corresponding control logics). <em><b>As for myself </b></em>, I was mainly responsible for the implementation of the UI and logics of menus in game, including mode selection (2 Players or AI), volume control (SFX & background music), game-scene switching, game pause & resume, start & exit, adding bgms and publishing our work to Google Play Store.
